"A Day Like Any Other" — a short story about rounding gone wrong

# A Day Like Any Other…

Bob (staring at a Python REPL, typing while yawning):

“Again.  
The re-encryption check breaks as soon as I tweak T by 1.  
This rounding logic feels like someone told it about quantum computing,  
so it decided to live in a superposition between two integers.”

Alice (looking at his plots, thoughtfully):

“Wait.  
Are you still assuming the rounding error is uniform?”

Bob:

“Well… yeah?  
Isn’t that what everyone does?  
‘Ideal quantization’, right?  
That’s what the papers say…”

Alice (grabs a laptop):

“Let’s actually check.  
For q = 3329, p = 512…”

Bob:

“q / (2p) is… 3.25.  
So max error is 3. Sounds fine.”

Alice (already opening Python):

“And the values?  
ε = Lift(Round(x)) − x?”

Bob (skeptical):

“You’re going to compute all 3329 values?  
No way that’s interesting.”

### Two hours later.

Alice (pulling Bob by the sleeve):

“Look at this.  
Max is 3 — fine.  
But the distribution… it’s not uniform.  
It has holes. Like Swiss cheese.”

Bob:

“What?  
(looks at the plot)  
That’s not ‘small noise’.  
That’s a deterministic pattern.”

Alice:

“And the variance is 3.617, not 3.523.  
It’s not huge — but it’s not negligible either.  
It’s like saying a bridge is safe with 97.3% confidence  
and you replying: ‘meh, that’s only 2.7% less’.”

Bob:

“Okay, but what do we do with that?  
We can’t rewrite all of lattice theory over 2.7%.”

Alice:

“What if… instead of pretending rounding is noise,  
we admit it’s the main character?  
Enumerate everything.  
Measure it exactly.  
And build guarantees from that?”

Bob:

“That’s… backwards compared to everything we do.”

Alice (smiles):

“So? Let’s try it. Just for fun.”

### One week later.

Alice:

“I built a hint system.  
It’s like rounding whispering:  
‘Hey, this coefficient is near the edge — keep an eye on it.’”

Bob:

“And it works?”

Alice:

“It does.  
And the hint is deterministic.  
You can compute it from (v, m) alone.  
No secrets. FO loves it.”

Bob:

“Wait…  
So you built a scheme where rounding isn’t background noise —  
it’s an explicit actor.”

Alice:

“Exactly.  
Once you know how rounding fails,  
you can predict where it fails  
and leave breadcrumbs to fix it.”

Bob:

“This is wild.  
A fully transparent mechanism where nothing is hidden.”

Alice (sudden movement, spills coffee on the keyboard):

“Damn.  
That’s actually a great paper title.  
‘Rounding-Explicit.’”

Bob:

“So what’s the failure probability?”

Alice:

“2⁻³⁶.  
Worse than Kyber, but…”  
(pause)  
“…proven.  
No ‘we hope’. Only ‘we know’.”

### A week later, at a café.

Bob:

“So… what do we do with this?”

Alice:

“Nothing.”

Bob:

“Nothing?”

Alice:

“RELC won’t replace Kyber.  
But now, whenever someone says  
‘rounding is just noise’,  
you can ask:  
‘Why don’t we measure it instead of assuming it?’”

Bob:

“A reference.  
Like a calibration standard for rounding error.”

Alice:

“Exactly.  
And maybe one day, when someone designs a new scheme,  
instead of hiding rounding in a footnote,  
they’ll write:  
‘Here is the exact distribution — like in RELC.’”

Bob (raises his glass):

“To an idea for dealing with unpredictability…  
by measuring it.”

Alice:

“And naming it.”

Bob:

“And threatening to publish it if it misbehaves.”

Both:

(clink glasses)

“Cheers.”
